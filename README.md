Fedora DNF Versionlock Plugin Ansible Role
=========

Implements basic subcommends of the DNF versionlock plugin. Does not provide ability to add DNF options.

Requirements
------------

Fedora is the only platform tested at the moment. It should work for any linux system that uses DNF for package management.

Role Variables
--------------

Variables that can be set in a playbook are listed below, along with default values if any. See `defaults/main.yaml` for more information.

| Variable   | Default Value | Notes |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----- |
| fdv_enabled | true | Enables (true) or disables (false) use of local repository |
| fdv_present | true | If false, removes dnf versionlock plugin rpm from system |
| fdv_cmd | none    | One of add, delete, exclude, list, clear |
| fdv_package_spec | none    | Required when fdv_cmd is one of add, delete, exclude. The package specification for versionlock to act on |
| fdv_raw | false    | Adds --raw option |

Technical Notes
---------------

Be sure to read and be familiar with the online documentation at https://dnf-plugins-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/versionlock.html. From the description: "versionlock is a plugin that takes a set of names and versions for packages and excludes all other versions of those packages. This allows you to protect packages from being updated by newer versions. Alternately, it accepts a specific package version to exclude from updates, e.g. for when itâ€™s necessary to skip a specific release of a package that has known issues."

The specific impetus for this role is to lock upstream kubernetes packages (kubectl, kubeadm, ) to the same version as cri-o from the Fedora repositories. Version control of cri-o in Fedora is handled by modularity. This plugin can lock a package to a specific minor version (e.g. 1.20) but allow patch releases to be installed without manual intervention (e.g. 1.20.1, 1.20.2, etc.).

Dependencies
------------

None

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
